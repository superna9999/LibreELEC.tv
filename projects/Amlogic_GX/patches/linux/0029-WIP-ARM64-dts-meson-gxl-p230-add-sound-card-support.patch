Subject: [PATCH 29/67] WIP: ARM64: dts: meson-gxl-p230: add sound card support

This commit add sound card support to the meson-gxbb-p230
his patch is not intended to be merged upstream. The architecture of
the sound card has not been determined yet. To handle the routing caps
of meson SoCs, we will probably have to make our own card.

This implementation using simple-card is provided for testing purpose only
